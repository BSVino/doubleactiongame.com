Over the course of this weekend we're expecting an increased number of cheaters using Double Action.

During this phase, and in general, please be extremely careful when encountering cheaters. Some recently surfaced cheats are known to be able to expose your external IP address to the cheater. Using that IP address, the cheater could, criminal energy provided, exploit vulnerabilities in your router, operating system and other services in order to damage or take over your computer and other devices on your network.

There's a certain risk associated with anything on the internet. The ability to expose a user's IP address comes from a fault in Source Engine, Valve's game engine, and not from the Double Action codebase. Cheaters ruin the experience for everyone else and I wish we could remove them entirely, but as a free game we lack the resources to do so. Double Action is a game about being stylish in a fun way, and cheaters are the least stylish thing of all. I'm sorry we weren't able to avoid cheaters.

When cheaters do show up on a server:
* Keep calm
* Do not engage
* Do not rage
* Seek another server

In other words, be your regular classy and stylish self. And most importantly, do not allow them to ruin your day :)";s:10:"post_title";s:18:"Beware of cheaters";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:6:"closed";s:11:"ping_status";s:6:"closed";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:18:"beware-of-cheaters";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2017-05-27 16:33:16";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2017-05-27 16:33:16";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:38:"http://www.doubleactiongame.com/?p=489";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}}
