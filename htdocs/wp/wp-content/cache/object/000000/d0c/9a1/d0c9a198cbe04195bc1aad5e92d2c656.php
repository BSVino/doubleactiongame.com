<strong>Be stylish!</strong> That means doing dives, flips, slides, and rolls, aiming in, using Brawl, and using grenades. As you do stylish things you will <strong>fill your style meter</strong> on the right of your screen. When it gets full, the style skill you chose will activate, giving you a short-term bonus. When you die, you will lose some of your style meter.

<strong>You collect seconds of slow motion for killing people in stylish ways.</strong> Don't forget to use your slow motion by pressing <strong>[C]</strong>. When you die you will lose two seconds of slow motion.

<strong>Mini-objectives are a great way to get style.</strong> Mini-objectives will appear periodically, such as Capture the Briefcase, Kill the Wanted Criminal, and Rat-Race to the Finish. Winning the objective will award you with a super style skill that's equivalent to all the style skills combined.

<strong>Diving away from explosions</strong> is the best way to avoid them. You'll take less damage, get style points, and you'll get a quick boost.

<strong>You can shoot through walls</strong> to get those pesky jerks who are trying to hide on the other side of one. It's super stylish, too. Shotguns don't penetrate walls too well, but pistols and rifles especially penetrate really well.

<strong>Your score is based on how stylish you are.</strong> The player who wins isn't the one who made the most kills, but the one who did the most stylish things. Dying's not so bad in this game, especially if you take your enemy with you (super stylish.)

<strong>Don't be afraid to fall off the edge!</strong> Some levels have high buildings you can fall from. If you fall, don't worry, maybe your enemy will dive after you, and you'll have a gun battle on the way to the ground.

<strong>Use the voting system.</strong> While in a server you can press escape to access the main menu, where you can call a vote to add bots, kick bots or players, change the level, and turn teamplay on or off.

<strong>Annoying players on voice chat?</strong> You can mute them by pressing escape to access the main menu, and choosing "Mute Players"
