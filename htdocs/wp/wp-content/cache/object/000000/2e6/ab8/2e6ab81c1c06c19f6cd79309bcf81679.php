	Other than the occasional post on ModDB or dev diary video we don&#39;t usually pimp this game too much, it being unfinished and all. So imagine my surprise when we heard that a group of well known YouTubers had posted videos of themselves playing our game. It was like seeing your third grade science project in the local newspaper. That&#39;s never actually happened to me since my science projects were all just me blowing things up, and I can&#39;t imagine why the local newspaper wouldn&#39;t find that interesting. So I guess you can think of Double Action as a third grade science project simulator.
