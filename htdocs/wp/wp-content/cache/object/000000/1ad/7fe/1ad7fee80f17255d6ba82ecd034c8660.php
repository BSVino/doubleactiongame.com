	At first I released an Alpha version. It was lacking in features but the gameplay was there. Then I released a Beta version. The features were there but it was lacking in gameplay. So instead of finishing the game I released an Omega version, which was actually pretty good, I thought. Now it seems as though the more Greek letters we use, the better our game gets! I think the quality increases are probably because of the Greek letters, and maybe might also have something to do with all the work we put into it. Today I&#39;m releasing the Delta version, which means the quality level should be somewhere between &quot;Acceptable&quot; and &quot;Gary Oldman&#39;s performance in The Fifth Element.&quot;

	The major improvements in the Delta version are the addition of a Capture the Briefcase mode and a burst-fire M16, but there&#39;s lots of other stuff in it too. You can download the Delta version <a href="http://forums.doubleactiongame.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=355">from this thread</a>. There will be a playtest all day Saturday.
