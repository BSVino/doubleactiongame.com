	<span>I&#39;ve ported Double Action to work with VR, and while DA isn&#39;t the greatest native VR game due to its fast pace and movement speeds,</span> it still turned out rather well.

	<span>Getting DA&#39;s third-person camera to work in VR wasn&#39;t straightforward, and a lot of the work I did to make the third person camera smooth and unobtrusive was nausea-inducing in the Rift and had to be thrown out. For example, pulling the camera in and out when the player moves helps create natural motion when viewed on a monitor, but only causes nausea when viewed through a VR headset, so that had to go. Also, the position behavior of the camera had to be changed to reduce the amount of camera movement as the player looks around. </span>

	<span>I also simplified the HUD a bit to make it more appropriate for VR. I dislike the &quot;floating HUD&quot; that you get in some VR games, so instead I tried placing the bullets in a line over the player&rsquo;s weapon.</span>

	<span>I wrote a more lengthy post that goes into some of the design details, you can read that <a href="http://bsvino.tumblr.com">on my blog</a>.</span> All of these changes will be in the next version of Double Action, due to be released soon.
