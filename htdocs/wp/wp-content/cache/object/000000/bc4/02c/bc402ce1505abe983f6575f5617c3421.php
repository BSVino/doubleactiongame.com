<strong>Is this game free?</strong> This game is free and we don't intend to ever sell it. It will never have ads. We may do microtransactions in the future, but these will never be pay-to-win.

<strong>Will this game be available for OS X?</strong> Yes, as soon as we find a team member who can maintain an OSX build. If you are or think you know such a person, please <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vino">contact me</a>.

<strong>Are there bots?</strong> There are bots if you want there to be bots. While you're in a game press the escape key and choose "CALL A VOTE". You can vote to add or kick bots. If you know how to use the console, you can type "bot_quota #" to get as many bots as you like.

<strong>Will this game be available in my native language?</strong> We hope to make a language pack for other languages available in the future. If you think you can assist with translation efforts, please <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vino">contact me</a>.
