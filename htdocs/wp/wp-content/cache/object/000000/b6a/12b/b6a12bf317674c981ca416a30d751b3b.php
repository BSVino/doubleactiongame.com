	That Game of Thrones finale last night was absolutely insane. Where the hell did those people on horses come from! Daenerys&#39;s dragon did what! And Tyrion, my lovely man, how could you!&nbsp;But personally I think it could have been improved a little bit if Jon Snow had backflipped through a window and unloaded a shotgun into Mance Rayder&#39;s face. Did Arya ever think to slide under a table heaped with drugs to clear a path with her submachine gun nicknamed &quot;The Undertaker&quot; so she could deliver a briefcase full of cash to the drop point? I think not.

	Game of Thrones may be over for this year (or until Winds of Winter comes out!) but Double Action is not! The new version out today, codenamed Kappa, is mostly bugfix/usability/gameplay updates, but it does contain some great new stuff like improvements to superfall -- that being, having a midair gun battle while falling off an 80 story building. As usual you can download it by clicking the golden button on the left. It should be the last version released before Boogaloo comes out for good on July 15!

	PS: Apologies to anyone who doesn&#39;t watch GoT, we&#39;re big fans on the DA development team. It was a pretty cool episode though.
