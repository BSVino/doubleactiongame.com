Double Action is made by a community of people all over the world. Anybody can contribute to the game. Our development team is 7 billion people strong. We think that open development and allowing anybody to help develop the game is a great way to collaborate and make a better game. But when there are so many people working on a game, we need some ground rules to help us coordinate our efforts.

<h2>1. Don't Be A Jerk</h2>
The Double Action team is full of nice people who care about the game and about each other. We like it that way. If you want to join our team, you'll be joining a team of people who have a mutual interest in each others success. There's no room for mean-spiritedness in this environment. Keep those personal attacks and harsh words away.

<h2>2. Don't Get Too Attached</h2>
In game development, many ideas get floated around. Many times work progresses in one area, and then later that work turns out to be the wrong direction or inappropriate, or simply outdated. It must be thrown away and replaced with better work. And so what happens often is that our precious hard work will get thrown away.

Don't worry about it. This is normal in game development. The cathartic process of throwing away old, bad work and replacing it with new, great work is essential for developing a great game. Things get thrown out all the time, so it's important not to get too attached to your own work, because it's more than likely that it will be thrown out.

Don't take it personally either. It's not a personal judgment. Just because it didn't work the first time doesn't mean the idea can't be improved. Try it again with a variation, or rework the idea. Maybe we can be convinced after all.

One important rule for developing a game is: Don't make anything that you're so attached to that you can't stand it not being in the game.

<h2>3. Your Work Belongs To The Community</h2>
When you make content for Double Action, your work belongs to the community. That is, it's no longer yours, but it doesn't belong to any individual person either. You can't "take it back" or dictate how it will be used. You signed up to work with the rest of the Double Action contributors, and part of that arrangement is that you trust them to use your work in ways that will benefit everybody. If you're not comfortable with this, just don't contribute.

Why do we have this rule? A few reasons. One is that a group of people can do better work than one person alone. A group of people can use everybody's strength's to their advantage. Another reason is that later on we may want to add a feature to the game that requires modifying your work. And finally the last reason is that we can't have people making stuff and then after it's been placed in the game coming back and demanding that we remove it, or change it in some strange way, or pay money for it. If everyone put rules and stipulations over their work, who can work on it, and what can be done to it, then it would arrest our ability to function and make improvements to Double Action.

Since the work belongs to the community, it's best that the sources for your work are available to the community. For example, if you made a player model, the original Maya file. If you made a map, the .vmf file. There are many people with many talents on this team, and if the sources to your work are available then someone later could come along and make it better in a way you hadn't thought of. It takes a lot of bravery to let go of your work, but it's better in the long term.

What contracts will we have to keep this system in place? Absolutely none. Contracts are expensive, and we're doing this for fun. I only ask that you not contribute unless you trust us and you're willing to join a community.

<h2>How Do I Contribute?</h2>
Just do it. Make something. Code something. Try something. If you want to make a weapon model, just make it. If you want to make some sounds, just make them. If you want an option for a special kind of third person camera, crack open the code and write it. When you're done, submit it to me and I will throw it into the game. We will try the game with your stuff and see how we like it. (We may not like it, in which case, see #2.) There's no formal process for joining the team, just make stuff and send it to me.
