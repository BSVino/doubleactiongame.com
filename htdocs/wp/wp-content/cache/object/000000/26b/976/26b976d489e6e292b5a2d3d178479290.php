The team is very proud to announce that <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/317360">Double Action is now available on Steam</a>. Thanks to everyone who participated in the beta and left bugs on the forums! We've fixed a heap of map errors and tuned up the gameplay. We'd love to do more but it's time to put this beast on the road!
<h4>Name the Next Version</h4>
"Boogaloo" has been the codename for our first version of Double Action. Now that it has been released and we're working towards the next update, we need a new name for the next version! We have chosen from a pool of names voted on by our forum community and after much deliberation, many backflips and a few akimbo headshots, we've narrowed the field to two, but we're leaving the final decision up to you.

<h4>So what's new?</h4>
If you've been playing our moddb version you'll notice some major updates to Rooftops and Trainingday. Rooftops has a fancy new skybox and Trainingday has an entirely new look. Streets got a bit of a touch up and bugfix while Cocaine and Sacred had some small tweaks.

We also want to say a huge thank you to Raizio from <a href="http://www.simrai.com">www.SimRai.com</a> for hosting our servers all through from a bitty beta up until release. He's practically one of the team and we couldn't have made it here without him.

<h4>So what's next?</h4>
We have big plans for our next update to DA. More content and more features to keep the stunts flowin and the style showin.
