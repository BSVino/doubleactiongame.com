There are a bunch of damage balances which should make the game a little more solid. Grenades are back on the buy menu, and have been balanced to account for it. It's only a small update but it has the potential to change the game quite a bit. We're looking for feedback on the changes, you can post it on the Steam discussion boards or on our own <a href="http://forums.doubleactiongame.com"/>forums</a>.

<h4>Name votes counted!</h4>
After tallying up the votes for our next version name (and there were a lot of them) It has been decided! Our development version of Double Action is now codenamed Doves of Fury.

You may be wondering what that means exactly. Here's the lowdown and dirty. Double Action: Boogaloo is the version you guys are playing on steam right now. We'll be putting small updates and such in that branch. Expect to see things like gameplay balances and small map updates. Double Action: Doves of Fury is the next major version we are working on. We have a checklist of stuff we want to add and when the checklist is completed DoF will be ready. Aforementioned stuff includes new maps, maybe characters and weapons, we're not 100% sure yet, but read on to find out more.

<h4>Upcoming</h4>
Abe (Black_Stormy) has been busy modelling away, the most recent item of note is this derringer model:

[sketchfab id=3adb6fb5963240d58ecbad369f77d186 width=800 height=600]

We're not totally sure how this will fit into the gameplay yet but we wanted a weapon that was high risk high reward. With this Derringer you only have two bullets so you gotta make em count. I'm thinking high damage close up (they have a hell of a slug) and mega style points if you manage to land a kill with it. The idea is to encourage players to pepper with a regular weapon and then switch to the Plan D to finish off.

Another idea for this weapon is to have it as an alternative to grenades. Players can either buy nades or a derringer, reducing the amount of nades on a map (hopefully). This could fit in with Vino's drug system in which players can purchase a health boosting syringe instead of a nade. The players choice then becomes health boost, derringer or grenade.

What do you guys think? How would you like to see it used in the game? And what other weapons would you guys like to see?

<h4>The Boogaloo Banana</h4>
We've had some new mappers come onto the scene recently and have set up a gamebanana page to provide a single download area for everyone. You can visit the page <a href="http://doubleaction.gamebanana.com">here</a> to check out what the community has been doing.  l-homme-d-action, our resident mod machine, has uploaded some custom <a href=http://doubleaction.gamebanana.com/skins/138019>characters</a> and <a href=http://doubleaction.gamebanana.com/skins/138022>weapons</a> among other stuff, and we recently saw <a href=http://doubleaction.gamebanana.com/maps/184212>da_tomb_raid</a> from TigerStyle. There's some other good stuff up there too and it's steadily growing. Thanks to everyone uploading there so far and if you have anything to upload please do!

<h4>Editors Choice MOTY 2014</h4>
In other news we were recently awarded #1 Editors Choice and the Ressie Award for ModDB's <a href=http://www.moddb.com/events/2014-mod-of-the-year-awards/features/mod-of-the-year-2014-editors-choice>Mod of The Year 2014</a>!<center><a href=http://www.moddb.com/events/2014-mod-of-the-year-awards/features/mod-of-the-year-2014-editors-choice><img src="http://www.doubleactiongame.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/MOTYEC1.png" alt="MOTYEC" width="800" height="203" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-448" /></a></center>
We haven't had a big presence on ModDB recently but that recognition certainly helps put fuel on the fire. Thanks to you guys for playing the game and spreading the word, and the ModDB guys for enjoying the game enough to put us in the spotlight.

<h4>Back to the old drawing board</h4>
Finally, if you're interested in keeping a look at development or you have something to share with the community, we've revived the old Double Action <a href="http://forums.doubleactiongame.com"/>forums</a>. Abe is posting his stuff up there and the community submissions forums is the place to be for anyone looking for or creating new maps and content for the mod. If you are interested, check out our <a href=http://www.doubleactiongame.com/workshop>docs</a> for information and inspiration and get to makin your next creation!

Until next time, may your Boogaloo be swift and merciless.
