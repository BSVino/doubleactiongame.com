	Last night as I was happily working on Double Action, I was visited by three ghosts. The first was The Ghost of Action Past, who showed me all the time I spent in my youth watching John Woo movies and playing The Specialists. It filled my heart with adrenaline. The second was The Ghost of Action Present, who showed me the downtrodden but stoically cheery people who are forced to play Double Action: Boogaloo while it&#39;s yet unfinished. The last was The Ghost of Action Future, who backflipped into a dive through a window and shot me nineteen times with his golden akimbo Berettas. It was rad. That&#39;s when I woke up from my dream, put aside my old Dickens novel and decided to ship Double Action: Boogaloo.

	I&#39;m happy to announce that Boogaloo is starting its &quot;Wrap-Up&quot; phase. Most of the coding work has been completed and our main tasks are now art and map related. Here are some of the things I&#39;ve wrapped up recently:
</p>

<p>
	<strong>BULLET TIME</strong>
</p>

</p>

<p>
	You&#39;ll have to dance to dodge these bullets, and if you&#39;re going to dance, you may as well Boogaloo.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>MONEYSPLOSION</strong>
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Every time the briefcase (which contains money) is dropped or captured, money flies everywhere. Why? Because it&#39;s damn hilarious, that&#39;s why.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>GOLDEN WEAPONS</strong>
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	When the Marksman skill is activated, the player&#39;s stylishness manifests as a golden material which plates the surface of your firearms. In other words, your guns go full bling.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>NEW MINI-OBJECTIVE: RAT RACE</strong>
</p>

<p>
	There are three waypoints. Whoever reaches the all three waypoints in order in a single life first wins. If you&#39;re in second place, you can either run faster, or gun for the guy who runs faster.
</p>

<p>
	All this and more will be in the next version of Boogaloo, which will show up sometime in the next few weeks. The team is now focusing on replacing the placeholder art and polishing the maps. If you&#39;re an artist and can build and compile weapon models, or if you&#39;re an animator, we need you! Post on <a href="http://forums.doubleactiongame.com/index.php">the forums</a> or <a href="mailto:bs.vino@gmail.com?subject=Double%20Action%20art">email me</a> (I&#39;m friendly!) to help us bring the game across the finish line.
