Double Action now has a reliable achievement system and we are ready to begin closed testing. Before we push the first batch to the public build, we need icons! This is where you and your fully sick MS Paint skills come in. If you want to put your own touch on the future of Double Action this is how to do it. Read on for the brief.

<h4>Icon specs</h4>
Each achievement needs one 64x64 colour icon (we'll use a desaturated and watermarked version for the 'locked' icon). The colour scheme must be simple and  match our current title icon:

<center><img src="http://sync.doubleactiongame.com/Logo/site_logo.png" /></center>

That is, black, white and yellow. You can also use the gold colour from <a href="http://sync.doubleactiongame.com/Logo/logo-solid-transparent-gold.png">this logo</a> for secondary details or highlights. Designs must be clear and readable, but you can use any style you like. Vector art, hand painted, 3d renders, it's all good as long they all look consistent.

<h4>Achievements</h4>
The icons should represent the achievement. I'm sure any avid achievement icon designer will have a ball coming up with their own designs. Here's the list of the first few we need:

<strong>Divepunch is its Own Reward</strong> - Get a divepunch kill
<strong>Michael Bay</strong> - Dive away from an explosion for reduced damage
<strong>Dodge This</strong> - Kill with a headshot at point blank range
<strong>SlowPro</strong> - Get three kills during one activation of slowmo
<strong>Skypunch</strong> - Kill a player with brawl during a superfall
<strong>Special Delivery</strong> - Cap the briefcase without killing anyone
<strong>Disco Stu</strong> - Earn 100,000 total style points
<strong>Potshotter</strong> - Get a long range pistol kill on an enemy holding a rifle

<h4>How to submit</h4>
Once you have made your icon you'll need to upload it to the net so we can check it out. If you don't already have an image service, <a href="http://postimage.org/">Postimage</a> is a good site. Then come to our super top secret <a href="http://forums.doubleactiongame.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=817">development forums</a> and post your icons! Even if you don't want to make icons for DA, feel free to come past the forums and contribute to the discussion anyway. We'll be picking the best icons that are consistent and clear reading.

There'll be more achievements coming soon and we'll need more icons so stay tuned to the Achievement Icons thread for more info as we have it!

Stay classy,
