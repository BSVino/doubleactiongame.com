That's correct! Double Action has received another slew of bugfixes and balances, changes and enhancements.

Punters will notice some additions to the scoreboard, as well as upgrades to spectator mode. Bots can now mantle and climb in some spots, and the hitmarkers for incoming fire will now dynamically scale with game resolution, making for a clearer impact on larger screens.

Our more experienced superfallers will notice that "WORTH IT!!" is now doled out less liberally, making for more intense and rewarding skybattles.

Additionally, gameplay has been tightened and bugs squashed, and the votekick system has received a tweakin. You can view the changelistÂ <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://github.com/BSVino/DoubleAction/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>.
