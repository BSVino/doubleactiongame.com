A mini-map-emission for our most dedicated Boogalooers? Damn Straight.

Bring it in tight for the latest map from Doum - a prison-themed shoot-em-up in the vein of your favourite badass brawlers. With tight hallways to concentrate the boom boom and high ceilings to exacerbate the zoom zoom, this map is a welcome addition to the Double Action library. Test your mettle in the showers but don't drop the soap! You'll have some slow-mo floatin gun totin drop soapin action heroes vying for your weak spots. Keep your head on a swivel and don't spare the dribble because it's time for a good old fashioned rumble on the catwalk. DEAD MAN DIVIN!
